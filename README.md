### Weather App with GUI
Developed a Java-based weather application with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide weather information based on user-inputted locations. 
This app displays information such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speeds.
Utilized Java Swing for GUI development, creating an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
Implemented dynamic image rendering to visually represent the weather conditions (e.g., clear, rainy, cloudy, snowy)
Integrated a weather forecast API and geolocation API in the backend to fetch real-time weather data for user-specified locations.
